        <h2>Demystify Elements</h2>
        <p>
            I've had my experience in front-end development; however, I'd like to get a better understanding on when to use some at the right time.
        </p>
        <p>
            You'll find that there are so many choices, and while many are very firm on when and how to use them, others are really up in the air.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <dl>
                    <dt>
                        &lt;Article&gt;
                    </dt>
                    <dd>
                        <p>
                            <em>Self-contained composition in a document/page.</em>
                            <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/article" target="_blank">Learn more from MDN</a>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This element can be a bit tricky trying to wrap your head around because it behaves like a page with multiple sections, but sometimes it's hard to know when a section of content is stand alone or better as a group.
                        </p>
                    </dd>
                </dl>
                
            </li>
            <li>
                <dl>
                    <dt>
                        &lt;linear-gradient&gt;
                    </dt>
                    <dd>
                        <p>
                            <em>
                                Creates an image consisting of progressive transition between two or more colors along a straight line.
                            </em>
                            <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/gradient/linear-gradient">Learn more from MDN</a>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I really want to get better at using <strong>linear-grdient</strong>. It's one of those magical elements that can transition wonderful visuals for your content.
                        </p>
                    </dd>
                </dl>
                
            </li>
            <li>
                While not a specific element, I'd like to learn more <strong>attributes</strong> that can assist elements in certain events, accessibility support, and performance improvement.
            </li>
